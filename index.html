                //if you uncomment this block of code, it breaks the page. when testing on my machine, I have found that when clicking on the tweet quote button, instead of going to any version of the link I am trying to build below, it tries to go to: file:///C:/Users/username/Documents/Free%20Code%20Camp/randomQuoteMachine/twitterLink . I'm confused on the code's logic to go to that "link" instead of what I have defined below. Also rather confused why it breaks the display of the quote when this code is uncommented. I am following https://youtu.be/pbWHp63-V3c?t=2568 to build this app. Any help would be much appreciated!!!
